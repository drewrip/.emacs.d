# .emacs.d
**Emacs configuration file**

I've recently started rewriting my config file for my current needs
while also scrapping some of the copy pasting I did for my first file.

Currently the config relies on all-the-icons because of treemacs, so you must
also run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts`.

My goal is to get LSP working so I can make emacs a bit more practical for my purposes.
Part of this will be setting up Rust Analyzer in emacs. See https://robert.kra.hn/posts/rust-emacs-setup/.
